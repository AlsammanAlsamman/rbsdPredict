Description: This package implements methods for predicting Rice Brown Spot Disease (RBSD) 
    caused by Bipolaris oryzae using environmental variables. It includes clustering-based 
    approaches, machine learning models, and hybrid methods to predict disease severity 
    indicators (A and PDI) based on temperature, humidity, and other meteorological factors.
